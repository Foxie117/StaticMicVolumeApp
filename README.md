# StaticMicVolumeApp
Forces microphone level to a fixed user-set value. App minimizes to tray without a taskbar icon.

### Intention
I created this app as a solution for the gazillion different applications and/or games that change the levels of your microphone without asking.
Results of this are people yelling at you to turn down the volume on your mic because your levels are way too high.
Currently this app is tailored toward my mic which is a Samson C03U.
If you want to use this for your own purposes you will have to adjust the code in the class "Microphone".

### Dependencies
- NAudio https://www.nuget.org/packages/NAudio/

### ToDos
- Let the user choose the target device aka microphone which levels are to be fixed
